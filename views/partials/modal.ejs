Chris has helped youth from Chicago to the Bay Area design 8 civic apps.

                            <p>Grove 3547 was an initiative of the Chicago Community Trust to bring together Bronzeville stakeholders (community residents, non-profits, civic leaders, and local government) to co-create innovative solutions. Worked with twenty stakeholders teaching the design process (empathy, define, ideate, prototype, test). Teams were coached and supported through each phase. The Grove teams created initiatives that included a job training program for youth and employee pipeline for small businesses in Bronzeville (Hire Local), a bicycle repair and food sustainability training program (GroveEco), and a local restorative justice hub for Bronzeville youth and families.</p>

                            <p>Innovative web-app designed to help young people expunge their criminal record. Worked with youth from across the Chicagoland area, the Justice Advisory Council of Cook County, Legal Assistance Foundation, and Smart Chicago Collaborative to create the web-app to help young people expunge their criminal record. Over 3 years the we worked with the young people to research, design and redesign the web-app to better meet the needs of their peers. We also created a CTA ad campaign to bring awareness to the issue and support to youth who need the service. The <a href="http://expunge.io" target="_blank">Expunge.io</a> project led to changes in Illinois expungement policy, such as the <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/rahm-emanuel-expunge-juvenile-arrest-records-261553551.html" target="_blank">Clean Slate Initiative</a>. <a href="http://expunge.io" target="_blank">Expunge.io</a> has been replicated in Philadelphia, Louisiana, and Maryland (so far).</p>

                                Chicago is known for many things: segregation, hard work, gangs, family, industry, music (so many different types), parks, labor movement, etc. Many of these experiences good and bad play a crucial role in shaping / All of these experiences make Chicagoans who they are: innovative, optimistic, and diverse. The unique qualities of the people and communities of this city are at the heart of the work that we do and it is crucial that we stay true to this spirit. And this is why we choose to base our work in this great city. ChiByDesign, with our hard work, connectivity, and innovative spirit can now design Chicago.

                            Design thinking is a way of working to help humans connect, unlock our hidden creativity, and create the world best suited for humanity. The foundation of design thinking is to build genuine empathy with and for those who need support. After you develop a deep understanding and connection with these people you begin to design creative solutions to the problem. ChiByDesign believes that empowering the folks who need the most support with this way of working can unlock limitless creative and effective solutions.

                                        <p>ChiByDesign specializes in community empowered design. During my work with the Chicago Community Trust and the Grove3547 program in the Bronzeville community I learned that designers donâ€™t need to parachute into communities and then design for them from the outside. Designers need to empower community members with a human centered design approach to navigate and develop solutions for the challenges affecting their lives. </p>
